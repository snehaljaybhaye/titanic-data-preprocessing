# Titanic Dataset Preprocessing 🧹🚢

This repository showcases data preprocessing techniques applied to the famous **Titanic dataset**. The goal is to clean, transform, and prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning modeling.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To demonstrate essential data preprocessing skills using Python, including:

- Handling missing data
- Removing duplicate records
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (normalization and standardization)
- Outlier detection using the IQR method

---

## 📂 Repository Contents

- `titanic_preprocessing.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step preprocessing.
- `titanic_transformed.csv` — Final cleaned Titanic dataset in CSV format.
- `requirements.txt` — Python libraries used in the notebook.
- `README.md` — Project overview and documentation.

---

## 📊 Dataset Source

This project uses the publicly available Titanic dataset:

🔗 [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv)

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

---

## ✅ Preprocessing Workflow

### 1. Load the Dataset
- Loaded using `pandas` or `seaborn` for quick access
- Explored first few rows

### 2. Handle Missing Values
- Dropped columns with more than 50% missing data
- Filled numeric columns with median
- Filled categorical columns with the most frequent value (mode)

### 3. Remove Duplicate Rows
- Checked for and removed duplicate entries

### 4. Encode Categorical Variables
- Used one-hot encoding for categorical features
- Converted boolean columns to 0/1

### 5. Feature Scaling
- Applied Min-Max Scaling to numeric columns
- Also compared results using Standard Scaler

### 6. Outlier Detection (IQR Method)
- Calculated IQR for key features
- Removed or capped outliers based on the 1.5 * IQR rule

## 🌟 Highlights

This project is a great starting point to:

- Build a strong data science foundation
- Showcase preprocessing skills on GitHub
- Reuse this template for future datasets or ML projects
